# 103 - CSharp Functions, Loops and Arrays

## Goal

This course will introduce you to writing reusable code using functions, using Loops in order to replace to `goto` Keyword and using `Array` for storing and using many values of the same kind.

# Grading

The grading allows you to skip the exercises, if you are confident enough.\
I recommend following this path:
- Beginner: Work your way through all exercises and then try yourself at implementing Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Intermediate: You may start implementing Tic-Tac-Toe and then try yourself at your own game.
- Advanced: Better score some save points with Tic-Tac-Toe first, but then you may try implementing a game of your own.

| Official Grade | Internal Grade  |  Requirement |
|--------------|-------|:-------------|
|VG|Summa Cum laude (A*)| Completed Tic-Tac-Toe near-flawlessly including a smart and a simple A.I., or proposed and implemented another Console Game Idea that uses functions and Arrays. |
|VG| Magna Cum Laude (A)| Completed the Tic-Tac-Toe assignment including one A.I. player. |
|VG|Cum Laude (B)| Completed the Tic-Tac-Toe assignment in a clean, playable state. |
|G|Passed (C)| Completed all exercises including the Tic-Tac-Toe game assignment, even if the code contains bugs / flaws. |
|G|Barely Passed (D)| Put in an effort of solving all exercises which did not involve implementing a whole game. |
|IG|Insufficient (E)| Put in a visible effort of solving the exercises. |
|IG|Failed (F)| Did not hand in any code. |

# 1 Functions
## Goal
Learn about scopes and functions. See, how we can use functions to pack code into reusable and parameterized blocks.

[Let's Get Started!](1-functions)

# 2 Loops
## Goal
Here, we will learn about using Loop-Keywords to structure our Program in repeatable iterations. This way, we can replace the use of the `goto`-Keyword with more standardized functions. Increasing our code's readability.

[Let's Get Started!](2-loops)

# 3 Arrays
## Goal
Learn about more complex data manipulation through Maths, Strings, Random Numbers and comparison, as well as code flow control through conditional code.

[Let's Get Started!](3-arrays)

# 4 Game On
## Goal
Pick either Tic-Tac-Toe or a Console Game of your own depending on your confidence in your abilities.\
You are allowed to complete multiple games, if you feel that you are up for the challenge.
